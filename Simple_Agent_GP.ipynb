            "Summary: Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman serving as the 47th president of the United States since January 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\n",
            "Born in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became president of his family's real estate business in 1971, and oriented it to luxury hotels and casinos. After several bankruptcies in the 1990s, Trump focused on licensing his name as a brand, and from 2004 to 2015 hosted and co-produced the reality television show The Apprentice. A political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n",
            "In his first term, Trump imposed a travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries, expanded the U.S.–Mexico border wall, and implemented a family separation policy. Domestically, he rolled back many environmental and business regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran's nuclear program; re-negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement; began a trade war with China; and met three times with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but did not reach an agreement on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from public health officials, and signed the CARES Act stimulus. Trump was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked Trump one of the worst presidents in American history.\n",
            "Trump is the central figure of Trumpism and the \"Make America Great Again\" movement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racist or misogynistic, and he has made false and misleading statements and promoted conspiracy theories to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden but refused to concede, falsely claiming electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results, including through his involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. In civil cases, he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, and business fraud in 2024. In 2024, Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony. After his victory in the 2024 presidential election against Kamala Harris, he was sentenced to a penalty-free discharge, and two other felony indictments against him were dismissed.\n",
            "Trump began his second presidency by pardoning approximately 1,500 January 6 rioters, implementing his mass deportation program, and starting a trade war with Canada and Mexico.\n",
            "\n",
            "Page: Family of Donald Trump\n",
            "Summary: The family of Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th president of the United States and owner of the Trump Organization, is an American family of German and Scottish descent. They are active in business, entertainment, politics, and real estate. Donald Trump, his third wife Melania, and their son Barron were the first family for the duration of his presidencies. Trump's father Fred was a son of German immigrants, while his mother Mary Anne MacLeod was a Scottish immigrant. Trump has five children from three wives, and ten grandchildren.\n"

During the Ottoman era, malouf was influenced by Turkish music. However, Tunisian repertoires, styles and also instruments remain distinctive – the ʻūd tūnsī is an emblematic case. This is a close relative of the 'uds associated with Algeria and also Morocco.\n",
