Making pasta is easy and delicious! Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:  

### **Ingredients:**  
🍝 For **fresh pasta dough:**  
- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (or 1 ½ cups flour + ½ cup semolina for texture)  
- 2 large eggs  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional)  
- Water (if needed, to adjust consistency)  

🍝 For **boiling pasta:**  
- Water  
- 1 tbsp salt  
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional, prevents sticking)  

### **Instructions:**  

#### **1. Making Fresh Pasta Dough**  
1️⃣ **Make a flour well:** On a clean surface or in a bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.  
2️⃣ **Add eggs & salt:** Crack eggs into the well, sprinkle salt, and add olive oil.  
3️⃣ **Mix:** Use a fork to slowly incorporate flour into the eggs until a dough forms.  
4️⃣ **Knead:** Knead the dough for **8–10 minutes** until smooth and elastic.  
5️⃣ **Rest:** Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest for **30 minutes** (this makes rolling easier).  
6️⃣ **Roll & cut:** Roll the dough thin using a rolling pin or pasta machine, then cut it into shapes like spaghetti, fettuccine, or lasagna sheets.  

#### **2. Cooking the Pasta**  
1️⃣ **Boil water:** In a large pot, bring water to a rolling boil. Add salt (makes the pasta flavorful).  
2️⃣ **Cook pasta:** Add pasta and cook fresh pasta for **2-4 minutes** (or dried pasta for **8-12 minutes**, depending on type).  
3️⃣ **Drain & serve:** Drain the pasta but keep a bit of pasta water if making a sauce (helps thicken it).  

### **3. Easy Sauce Ideas**  
- **Marinara:** Sauté garlic in olive oil, add canned tomatoes, basil, salt, and simmer.  
- **Alfredo:** Melt butter, add heavy cream and parmesan, then mix with pasta.  
- **Garlic & Olive Oil:** Sauté garlic in olive oil, add red pepper flakes, toss with pasta.
