[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deluminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.]

Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.

[The cat silently looks at him, and the camera turns towards a wall. The cat's shadow turns into a woman with a tall hat and emerald robes. There are footsteps and Minerva McGonagall is revealed.]

McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?

Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.

McGonagall: And the boy?

Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

Dumbledore: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.

[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid takes off his goggles.]

Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?

Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.

[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]

McGonagall: Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...

Dumbledore: The only family he has.

[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]

McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.

[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.]

Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.

[Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.]

Dumbledore: Good luck... Harry Potter.

[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]

The Vanishing Glass
[The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs]

Petunia: Up! Get up! [She knocks on his closet door repeatedly] Now! [Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room]
[Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.]
Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
[Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs, and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.]
Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
Vernon: Happy birthday, son.
[Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes.]
Petunia: [to Harry, unpleasantly] Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.
[Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon]
Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Vernon: [to Harry, who is taking his time placing the bacon on the plates] Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.
[Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.]
Petunia: Aren't they wonderful, darling?
Dudley: How many are there?
Vernon: 36. Counted 'em myself.
Dudley: 36?! But last year... last year I had 37!!
Vernon: Err, yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year.
Dudley: I don't care how big they are!
Petunia: [calming him down] Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?
[Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Echoing from the book, Harry was meant to be staying with his babysitter Mrs. Figg. While Dudley's parents took him and a friend --from Dudley's school-- out for the day --on his birthday-- either to amusement parks, hamburger restaurants for lunch or dinner, or the movies, Harry was meant to be staying with Mrs. Figg. Mrs. Figg was a mean old lady who lived two streets away. But since she broke her leg, the Dursleys were forced to take Harry to the zoo. That is because there was no one else to replace Mrs. Figg. Not even Aunt Marge --Uncle Vernon's sister-- nor Aunt Petunia's friend Yvonne. Yvonne --Aunt Petunia's friend-- was on vacation in Majorca. In the meantime, the viewers now see the house morning. And the family is heading to the car.]
Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
[Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him.]
Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy! Any funny business, any at all, and you are not going to have any meals for a week! Get in!
[At the London Zoo, the Dursley family is in the reptile house. After lunch --at the zoo restaurant-- Harry and the Dursleys went to the reptile house to see the reptiles. Harry looks at a large Boa constrictor.]
Dudley: Make it move.
[Vernon taps the glass of the cage.]
Vernon: Move!
[Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces.]
Dudley: MOVE!
Harry: He's asleep!
Dudley: He's boring.
[Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.]
Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. [The snake looks up and blinks.] Can you...hear me? [The snake nods] It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? [The snake shakes its head] You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family? [The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity] I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
[The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor.]

Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
[Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance.]
Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
[Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.]

Snake: Thanksss.
Harry: Anytime.
[The snake slivers off to the exit.]
Man: SNAKE!
[There is a lot of people screaming throughout the reptile house as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped in the snake exhibit, he pounds the glass in panic.]
Dudley: Mum, mummy!
Petunia: [notices him in the exhibit and screams]
Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!
Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there!? Is there a snake?!
[Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harry's grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon.]
Letters from No One
[Cut back to the Dursley family's house. Aunt Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in. Dudley is crying --because he is cold and wet-- and wrapped up in a towel.]
Petunia: [assuring a distressed Dudley] It's all right, sweetheart. Let's get you out of those terrible clothes.
[They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall. Then he --Vernon-- grabs Harry by the hair.]
Harry: Ow!
Vernon: WHAT HAPPENED?!
Harry: I swear, I don't know! [Vernon snarls] One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
[Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door]
Vernon: There's no such thing as magic! [he blackens out the vent on the door]
[An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses' roof]
(Extended Version)

[The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.]

Petunia: Awww, smile. [She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy.] Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
Vernon: Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
Harry: Will I have to wear that, too?
[They draw their attention to Harry]

Petunia: What, you? Go to Smeltings? [Harry nods, questionably]
Vernon: Ha!
[They laugh in amusement]

Petunia: Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong. [Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.] And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
Harry: But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
Petunia: It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post. [Harry then heads to the hallway] Go!
(Normal Version)

[Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy dying Harry's clothes. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.]

Vernon: [after reading a postcard] Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.
[Dudley suddenly notices Harry's letter and runs to grab it from him and give it to his father.]

Dudley: Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Vernon: Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
[The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps. Much later, another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up. In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.]

Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.
[Harry quietly closes the cupboard door. The next day, Vernon and Petunia are outside the door. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.]

Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
[She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.]

Vernon: Shoo! Go on!
[She notices something and pats Vernon on the shoulder to get his attention, and what they see is more letters addressed to Harry.]

(Extended Version)

[Later, Petunia is cracking a egg into a bowl, and what instead comes out is a folded-up letter. She cracks another one, but another letter comes out as well. She then cracks yet another one, but the same happens again. She stares at the letter, and then she hears the owls screeching. She draws her attention to the outside of the window, and what she sees is four owls sitting on some garden chairs. Petunia then screams and runs off.]

(Normal Version)

[Much later, Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in. The scene fades to the next day, the family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.]

Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?
Harry: [when Dudley shrugs and didn't answer, as Harry hands a cookie to Vernon] Because there's no post on Sunday?
Vernon: Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one. [Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.] No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
[As Vernon was talking, a letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernon's face, cutting him off. There is a rumbling and then millions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace. The family shrieks in horror as Harry watches in amazement.]

Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! [He jumps on Petunia's lap as she and Vernon continue screaming] What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
[Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.]

Vernon: Go away! Ahh! Give me that! Give me that letter!
[He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.]

Harry: Get off! Ahh!
[Vernon restrains Harry as several letters begin to shoot everywhere around the house.]

Vernon: Ahh!
Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!
[The wood plank nailed in front of the letterbox finally breaks from the excess pressure of the letters shooting through the letter.]

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
[Petunia watches with a horrified look on her face, knowing that Dudley may be right.]

Keeper of the Keys
[That stormy night, a tall house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The Dursleys, including Harry have moved there, due to the chaos with the letters. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor and Dudley sleeping on a sofa. Harry has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.]

Harry: [to himself] Make a wish, Harry. [he blows the "candles" on the drawn birthday cake]
[Suddenly, the door thumps, in sync with the thunder flashing. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Harry hides behind a wall, and Dudley cowers on a windowsill. Petunia and Vernon appear, with Vernon holding a double barrel gun.]

Vernon: Who's there?! Ahh!
[The door bangs again and then falls down, and a giant man appears. As he comes into the clear lighting, the giant man himself reveals to be Rubeus Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Sorry about that. [He puts the door back up]
Vernon: [aiming his gun at him] I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
[As Petunia quietly gasps in fear, Hagrid grabs the gun and bends it upwards.]

Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. [The gun fires upwards, blasting a hole in the ceiling, causing the two to shriek in fear. Hagrid notices Dudley.] Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry. But yer a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle.
Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.
[Harry reveals himself]

Harry: I-I am.
Hagrid: Well, of course you are! Got somethin' for yeh. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh.
[Hagrid hands Harry the cake]

Hagrid: Baked it myself, words and all. Heh.
[Harry opens cake, which reads "Happee Birthdae Harry" in green frosting.]

Harry: Thank you!
Hagrid: It's not every day that yer young man turns 11, now is it? Aye?
[Hagrid sits down on the sofa, takes out an umbrella, and points it at the empty fire. Two sparks fly out of the umbrella and start a fire. The Dursley family gasps.]

Harry: [puts cake down] Excuse me, who are you?
Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. O' course, yeh'll know all about Hogwarts.
Harry: Sorry, no.
Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where yer mum and dad learned it all?
Harry: Learnt what?
Hagrid: Yer a wizard, Harry.
[Harry looks confused]

Harry: I-I'm a what?
Hagrid: A wizard. And a thumping good one, I'd wager, once yer trained up little.
Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I mean, I can't be... a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.
Hagrid: Well, Just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? [Harry softens his expression] Ah.
[Dudley whimpers. Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it and he began to read.]

Harry: "Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
Vernon: [to Hagrid] He will not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in, we'd put a stop to all this rubbish!
Harry: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. "We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful?" I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter. And then she had you, and I knew you would be the same. Just as strange, just as... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.
Harry: [to Petunia, angrily] Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?!
Petunia: We had to say something.
Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
[As the Dursleys argue with Hagrid, no one, including Harry, is noticing Dudley taking Harry's cake away]

Vernon: He'll not be going!
Hagrid: Oh-ho-ho, and I suppose a great muggle like yerself's goin' to stop him, are yeh?
Harry: Muggle?
Hagrid: [to Harry, calmly] Non-magic folk. [he immediately draws his attention back to Vernon and Petunia in anger] This boy's had his name down ever since he were born! [As Hagrid was talking, Dudley was munching on Harry's cake.] He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.
[Harry smiles upon hearing Dumbledore's name]

Vernon: I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks!
[Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it at Vernon, threateningly.]

Hagrid: NEVER. INSULT. ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. IN FRONT OF ME.
[Hagrid finally sees Dudley eating Harry's cake and aims his umbrella at his buttock. He fires a magic spark at it, causing a pig's tail to grow.]

Dudley: Ahh!
[The Dursleys shriek in both fright and horror as they run off out of sight. Harry laughs at this, so does Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Harry: [Nods] Okay.
Hagrid: [checks his pocket-watch] Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Bes' be off. [he goes off to the door and pulls it down again before stepping out. He turns to Harry] Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?
[He walks out. Harry grins, looks back at the direction where the Dursleys are gone, and grins again, before grabbing his jacket and joins Hagrid on their journey to London.]

Diagon Alley
[The next day, in the streets of London.]

(Extended Version)

[Harry and Hagrid are in the underground tube.]

Harry: [reading the list] First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. [He turns to Hagrid]
Hagrid: Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Harry: One pair of dragon-hide gloves. [he turns to Hagrid again] Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?
Hagrid: Well, they don't mean a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, I'd love a dragon.
Harry: You'd like a dragon?
Hagrid: Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood. [He suddenly eyes a woman and then he nods. The woman returns to reading her paper.]
(Normal Version)

[The next scene, Hagrid and Harry are walking down the streets.]

Harry: All students must be equipped with... one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad. Could we find all this in London?
Hagrid: If you know where to go.
[They walk towards a corner store and as they get closer, the sign above it has “The Leaky Cauldron” magically appearing. They enter the Leaky Cauldron. There was music and several patrons that are speaking to each other.]

Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helpin' young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!
[The pub immediately goes silent and everyone notices. A man comes up and shakes Harry's hand.]

Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome back.
[A witch comes up and shakes Harry's hand, as well.]

Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
[A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is Professor Quirrell.]

Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.
Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. [puts out his hand, offering a handshake with Quirrell. But he looks at Harry's head and hesitatingly refuses]
Quirrell: F-fearfully f-fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
Hagrid: Yes, well, mus' be goin' now. Lots to buy. Heh-heh-heh.
Harry: Goodbye.
[The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.]

Hagrid: See, Harry? You're famous!
Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
Hagrid: I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry. [Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks then magically shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street called Diagon Alley.] Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. [Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.] Here's where yeh'll get yer quills and yer ink, and over there all yer bits and bobs fer doing yer wizardry.
[Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.]

Girl: It's a world class racing broom.
Boy 1: Wow! Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
Boy 2: It's the fastest model yet. [the camera pans to see the broom's model name on the handle]
Gringotts
[Harry and Hagrid continue walking down Diagon Alley]

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
Hagrid: Well, there's yer money, Harry. [he points to a tall, white, marble building, Gringotts Bank] Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'ain't no safer place, not one. 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.
[Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working at their desks.]
Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Bes' stay close. [Harry sticks to him. Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin, wearing spectacles and a waistcoat, in it.] Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
[The goblin looks up.]

Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Hagrid: Oh, wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Ha! There's the little devil. [Whispers] Oh, and there's something else as well. [Takes out a letter wrapped in a string.] Professor Dumbledore gave me this. [Hagrid hands the Goblin the letter.] It's about You-Know-What in vault You-Know-Which.
Goblin: Very well.
[Later, they race down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, and a goblin, called Griphook, clambers out.]

Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. [Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault] Key, please.
[Hagrid hands him the key and Griphook unlocks the vault. The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.]

Hagrid: Didn't think yer mum and dad will leave you with nothing now, did yeh?
[They continue on through the cavern.]

Griphook: Vault 713.
Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?
Hagrid: Can't tell yeh, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Griphook: Stand back. [Slides finger down the door. The vault opens to reveal a small white stone package. Hagrid enters the vault and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.]
Hagrid: Bes' not to mention this to anyone, Harry.
[Harry nods in agreement]

Ollivanders
[Outside back in Diagon Alley, Harry and Hagrid are walking through the street. Harry has bought most of his equipment, and is reading his list.]

Harry: I still need... a wand.
Hagrid: A wand? Well, yeh'll want Ollivanders. [he points to the store] There ain't no place better. Why don't you run along there and wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
[Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands in boxes, but no people.]

Harry: [Softly] Hello? Hello?
[Then, a noise came from the back, and a man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. The man is Ollivander and he smiles.]

Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. [Picks a wand] Ah. Here we are. [Harry holds it, but does nothing] Well, give it a wave. [Harry is hesitant, but waves. This causes most of the boxes to come flying out and crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.] Apparently not. [Ollivander gets another wand from a box.] Perhaps this. [Harry waves at a vase, which shatters, startling Harry.] No, no, definitely not! No matter. [gets a wand from a box but stops and becomes thoughtful] I wonder... [Ollivander hands the wand to Harry. No sooner after he touched it, Harry suddenly glows under it, blowing his hair up and several of the paperwork in the background. Ollivander looked a bit surprised and deep in thought.] Curious. Very curious.
Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?
Ollivander: [examining the wand he gave to Harry] I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave another feather, just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. [Points to the lighting bolt scar on Harry's forehead]
Harry: And who owned that wand?
Ollivander: We do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible, yes, but great. [he hands Harry back his wand.]
[Harry then hears a knock on the window.]

Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! [Has a snowy owl in a cage, which hoots, his name is Hedwig.]
Harry: [amazed] Wow.
The Boy Who Lived
[Later back in the Leaky Cauldron, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup. Everything is too quiet, Hagrid soon notices this.]

Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.
Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do.
Hagrid: [sighs and pushes his bowl away] First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?
Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. [quietly] Voldemort.
Harry: Voldemort?
Hagrid: Shh!!
[Harry looks around to see if anyone heard it]

Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [We flash over to a flashback on the night at Godric's hollow, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.] Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. [Harry's mother, Lily, screams in pain as she is killed by Voldemort's wand. Green flashes are seen from the windows outside the house. Then, we see Voldemort pointing his wand at an infant Harry Potter's head.] Nobody, not one. ‘Cept you.
[We flash back to the present time.]

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.
Harry: What happened to V... to You-Know-Who?
Hagrid: Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there still, too tired to carry on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why yer famous. That's why everybody knows yer name. You're the boy who lived.
